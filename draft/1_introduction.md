# Decentralized Trusted Content Protocol


## Introduction

Before DTCP there are already attempts on adding metadata to information,
the most famous one is [Dublin Core Metadata Initiative](http://dublincore.org), or DCMI.
During the development of DTCP we will keep fields in DTCP as compatible as possible to DCMI.
DTCP can be considered as an implementation of DCMI using blockchain technology.
