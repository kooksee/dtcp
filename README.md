## Decentralized Trusted Content Protocol

DTCP is a new layer, protocol and infrastructure added to the current internet
to create inalterable, traceable metadata to content like articles, images or videos.
DTCP aims to bring trust to the whole internet, With the power of blockchain technology,
it makes the content more trustworthy,
encourages its spreading with copyright protected, and improves its usability.

Before DTCP there are already attempts on adding metadata to information,
the most famous one is [Dublin Core Metadata Initiative](http://dublincore.org), or DCMI.
During the development of DTCP we will keep fields in DTCP as compatible
as possible to DCMI. DTCP can be considered as an implementation of DCMI
using the Blockchain technology.

This repository contains the working draft of the specifications of this protocol.
